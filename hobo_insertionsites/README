PwHy element was used as a deficiency generator. If the hobo tranposase was present, H jumped (preferably locally), and cross-over happened, leading to deletion.
2 different starting points (2 original PwHy insertion sites, both on 2R) were examined in details to find the deletion end points. Sequences were deposited into GenBank.

hobo_insert.sh
- downloads reference sequence (2R chromosome)
- downloads original insertions sites for 2 strains. 
- blasts deposited seqs agaisnt 2R, saves summarized table (2 files for 2 different starting points), filters alignment >80bp and save locations (2 files for 2 strains, used later for Gviz graph)
- combines sites, generates bed and fasta files for 10bp, 20bp, and 100bps window around sites. 

DNase_coverage.R 
- draw plots showing average Dnase-Seq coverage (data from Kc cell or embryonic cells) in 200bp window centered around insertion sites
- currently plotting data for W strain
Due to storage issue, Dnase-Seq data of Kc and embryonic cells were processed in Galaxy, which is viewable via https://usegalaxy.eu/u/allendinh/h/hobo-insertion-sites 

genomic_view.R
- plot genomic regions of insertion sites.
- tracks including gene annotation from ensemble, insertion sites, and chromatin states (data obtained from FlyBase which was then processed and subsetted with R. This R code is not included but processed data is in data folder). 
- currently plotting region for W strain

site_vs_chromatin.R
- counts number of insertion sites of each chromatin state of Kc cells. 
- currently using W strain insertion information. 

A few additional analysis were also performed via Galaxy.
