PwHy element was used as a deficiency generator. If the hobo tranposase was present, H jumped (preferably locally), and cross-over happened, leading to deletion.
2 different starting points (2 original PwHy insertion sites, both on 2R) were examined in details to find the deletion end points. Sequences were deposited into GenBank.

hobo_insert.sh file
- downloads reference sequence (2R chromosome)
- downloads original insertions sites for 2 strains. 
- blasts deposited seqs agaisnt 2R, saves summarized table (2 files for 2 different starting points), filters alignment >80bp and save locations (2 files for 2 strains, used later for Gviz graph)
- combines sites, generates bed and fasta files for 10bp, 20bp, and 100bps window around sites.
